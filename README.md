# UI-design

I decided to choose https://www.barbican.org.uk/ website as my development project. During the course called "User Interface Design and Development" I try to imitate above-mentioned website using HTML5 and CSS together with Bootstrap framework. 

As I do not have previous experience with Bootstrap I thought this could be a good opportunity to get better knowledge of one of the most popular framework in the world. After researching more about Bootstrap I understood that it enables to develop attractive and contemporary design with rather simple tools. Also it would be nice to have Bootstrap skills in my resume as it is widely used in web development.
